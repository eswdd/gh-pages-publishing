gh-pages-publishing
===================

Simple utils to ease publishing to github pages for how we choose to structure our code/documentation.

Expected repository structure
-----------------------------

**&lt;entity>/&lt;code-repo-name>**

Branches:
* gh-pages - where we publish our documentation to and where github expects to find it, and which contains top-level documentation which is not version specific
* Others as required by the library

**&lt;entity>/&lt;code-repo-name>-documentation**

Branches:
* One for each code branch except "gh-pages"

Publishing branch documentation
-------------------------------

Run:

```
./publish.sh <entity/code-repo-name> <branch-name> <github-username>
e.g.
./publish.sh betfair/maven-test-process-plugin master eswdd
```



Which will perform the following:

* Remove all docs from repository &lt;entity/code-repo-name> with branch "gh-pages" in folder &lt;version>
* Copy all docs from repository &lt;entity/code-repo-name>-documentation with branch &lt;version> to that directory
* Generate the maven site for that branch and place in a "maven" subdirectory

Top level docs which are not version specific are held in &lt;entity/code-repo-name> with branch gh-pages.
